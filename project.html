        <p>"Ampcontrol is excited to announce that in collaboration with @Sen Engineering Solutions, Inc., we have designed, manufactured and extensively tested the world’s first commercial-grade Sen Transformer, a patented technology, that acts as an Impedance Regulating Transformer. Sometimes, there comes a technical advancement that is simple, elegant and effective.</p>

        <p>Sen Transformer marks the first breakthrough in bulk power system design in more than a century, hosting a range of benefits over traditional power flow solutions. Sen Transformer, which offers a plethora of power flow control features, such as independent active and reactive power flows, voltage, phase angle, impedance, all in one unit, uses time‐tested components, such as transformer and load tap changers that are proven to be reliable, cost‐effective, and portable to meet today’s needs to modernize the grid.</p>

        <p>A commercial-grade Sen Transformer was designed to operate at 33 kV with a throughput rating of ±6.5 MVA. The unit was manufactured and tested to demonstrate the proof of concept. The test results show that the bidirectional active and reactive power flows can be regulated independently, proving that the Sen Transformer is a practical solution to meet utilities’ needs in terms of reliability, cost-effectiveness, component non-obsolescence, efficiency, portability and interoperability.</p>

        <p>The Sen Transformer is being further tested in a 33 kV radial line at the EPRI lab in the USA."</p>

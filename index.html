      <h2>What is a SMART Power Flow Controller (SPFC)?</h2>
      <p>
        A SPFC enhances power transmission controllability using functional requirements and cost-effective solutions. It combines the best of all power flow technologies — electronics-based or otherwise — to optimize grid performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its main job is to independently control active and reactive power flows in electric transmission lines, maximizing efficiency and reliability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Reduce reactive power within limits while maintaining voltage stability. Increase active power up to the thermal limits. The SPFC achieves this with independent power flow control.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduces reactive power losses → increases efficiency</li>
        <li>Reduces environmental impact</li>
        <li>Frees up grid components for more active power</li>
        <li>Redirects power to underutilized lines → reduces grid congestion</li>
        <li>Delays costly new transmission lines</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>SMART Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>S</strong> – Specific: Meet utility needs</li>
        <li><strong>M</strong> – Measurable: Reliable, efficient, portable</li>
        <li><strong>A</strong> – Attainable: Realistic outcomes</li>
        <li><strong>R</strong> – Relevant: Power grid efficiency</li>
        <li><strong>T</strong> – Time-bound: Milestone-driven delivery</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Sen Transformers (ST)</h2>
      <p>
        STs, placed at strategic locations, help control power flow without building new lines — reducing cost and environmental impact while improving power delivery efficiency.
